## Update April 12, 2020

We have updated the script to make it compatible with the new configuration of The Pirate Bay.

Description
===========

This is a PHP script that allows you to create a proxy site for The Pirate Bay. 

A proxy site allows users to access The Pirate Bay on networks where it is blocked.

Install
=======

To install it, you will need to upload the files to a web server which supports PHP and the PHP Curl library.

Afterwards, you can request to have your proxy site added to our list at: [https://proxybay.onl](https://proxybay.onl)
